Some useful algorithms that I usually review before any Software Engineer interview.
The implementation is on Java. 

I added other common computer science problems with a good solution looking for optimization and also implemented in Java.

## Sorting algorithms
* HeapSort
* MergeSort
* QuickSort

## Dynamic Programming problems
* Knapsack Binary
* Levenshtein Distance
* N Queens

## Graph algorithms
* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Search

## Exercises
* Trap Water
* Validate number
